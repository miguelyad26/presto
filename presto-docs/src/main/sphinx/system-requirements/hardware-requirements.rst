Hardware Requirements
=====================

**Memory**

You should allocate a minimum of 16GB of RAM per node for Presto. But recommend 64GB for most production workloads.

**Network Bandwidth**

It is recommended to have 10 Gigabit Ethernet between all the nodes in the cluster.

**Other Recommendations**

Presto can be installed on any normally configured Hadoop cluster. YARN should
be configured to account for resources dedicated to Presto. For example, if a
node has 64GB of RAM, perhaps you would normally allocate 60GB to YARN.  If you
install Presto on that node and give Presto 32GB of RAM, then you should
subtract 32GB from the 60GB and let YARN only allocate 28GB per node. An
optimized configuration might choose to have separate Presto and Hadoop nodes.
The optimized configuration allows you to give more memory to Presto, and thus
perform larger join queries, for example.
